# Galapagos Tortoise Phylogenomics

These scripts detail the computational methods used in Jensen, Gaughran et al. 2022.

summary_dxy.py outputs the Dxy estimate between pairs. plot_dxy.py plots those estimates according to species, island, and morphology. tortoise_meta_data.txt provides metadata for each tortoise specimen. 

Note: scripts will need to be edited for use in other systems, according to the metadata columns used.
